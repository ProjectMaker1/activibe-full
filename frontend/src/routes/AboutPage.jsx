        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>
          <strong>ActiVibe – The Vibe of Activism</strong> is a global digital
          platform connecting young people to non-violent campaigns and peaceful
          movements around the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe many young people want to create change, but don’t always
          know where to begin. Information about activism is often scattered,
          overwhelming, or difficult to access. ActiVibe makes it simple.
        </p>

        <h3>Our platform combines:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A global database of verified non-violent campaigns</li>
          <li>AI-guided tools to help users discover relevant causes</li>
          <li>Opportunities to connect, contribute and learn</li>
          <li>A safe and youth-friendly digital environment</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We are building a space where awareness becomes action — safely,
          creatively and responsibly.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          To make peaceful activism accessible, visible and inspiring for young
          people worldwide.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          A global generation of informed, creative and responsible changemakers
          who use non-violent methods to improve their communities.
        </p>

        <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
        <p>
          ActiVibe is not just a database. It is an interactive platform that
          guides users toward meaningful action based on their interests,
          skills, and values.
        </p>

        <h3>We focus on:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Non-violent civic engagement</li>
          <li>Youth empowerment</li>
          <li>Cross-cultural understanding</li>
          <li>Safe digital participation</li>
        </ul>
